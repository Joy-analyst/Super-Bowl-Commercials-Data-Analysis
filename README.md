##  Dataset Description
| Column | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Year** | Year of the Super Bowl commercial |
| **Brand** | Company/Brand name |
| **Funny, Celebrity, Patriotic, Danger, Animals, Uses Sex** | Binary indicators of ad characteristics |
| **Length** | Duration of the ad (in seconds) |
| **Estimated Cost** | Approximate cost of the ad (in millions) |
| **YouTube Views** | Number of YouTube views |

## 📈 KPIs
- **Total Number of Ads**
- **Average Estimated Cost per Ad**
- **Average YouTube Views per Ad**
- **Average YouTube Likes per Ad**
- **Engagement Rate (Likes ÷ Views)**
- **Top Performing Brand by Engagement**

Engagement Rate = YouTube Likes / YouTube Views


**Example:**  
If an ad has 13,615 views and 84 likes →  
`84 / 13,615 = 0.00617 = 0.62%`
